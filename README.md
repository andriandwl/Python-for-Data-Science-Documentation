> Welcome! Are you completely new to programming? If not then I presume you will be looking for information about why and how to get started with Python for Data Science. Fortunately, an experienced programmer in any programming language (whatever it may be) can pick up Python very quickly. It's also easy for beginners to use and learn, so jump in!

> In this repository Python required for Data Science is documented and still under construction. It's helpful to beginners. All the documentation (Jupyter Notebooks) is completed in 5 Modules. If you found any bug or mistake in the repository inform me.
